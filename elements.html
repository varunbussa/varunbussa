										<p>After Gamestop’s and AMC’s stock dramatically increased over a period of a few days in 2021, questions about how the public and social media affected the trend of a stock arose. More specifically, public sentiment, or emotion, was identified as a potential variable which affected stock value. However, the introduction of this new variable throws a wrench in the current approach of algorithmic stock trading which is based on factors such as timing, quantity, and prices. In order to account for this variable, machine learning models could be used to predict public sentiment about a certain stock based on tweets. In this study, an analysis of multiple types of machine learning models was done in order to find which one was the most accurate at predicting public sentiment. Three different models were built and tested: Logistic Regression, Long Short-term memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). It was found that the model based on BERT was the most accurate at classifying public sentiment. As a result, it is discussed that BERT may be implemented in Algorithmic trading to improve performance. The applications of BERT in other realms, such as smart assistants, are also discussed.

										<p>Due to increasing demand for smart home technologies, the demand for smart locks is also expected to increase in the coming future. However, due to the unique nature of smart locks, which controls an integral part of one’s life (home security), future demand for smart locks may not be as stable as expected. An initial review of variables was conducted to determine what might have an effect on smart lock adoption. Perceptions of security, socio-economic factors, and personality were identified as factors. This review led to the question: How do socioeconomic factors and perceptions of security, aided by the current information available, affect the adoption rate of smart locks? A pre- and post- survey method was used to answer this question. During analysis of the data, statistical tests showed that perceptions of safety did not change between the pre- and post- survey. However, knowledge about smart locks did increase. The results support the Privacy Paradox. It is recommended that advertising that focuses on the benefits of smart locks only is effective in keeping smart lock demand stable in the short-term.
